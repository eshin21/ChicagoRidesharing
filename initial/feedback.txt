This is shaping up well: I think that it should be an interesting and compelling
project.  Some questions:

0) what is TNP?  Does it only include taxis?  Is there any other ride-sharing included?

1) can you please start to work to access Census/ACS data for Chicago?  This will help me assess whether you can answer your quite interesting questions.  Adding some small excerpts and codebooks would be ideal.

2) can you map from addresses to census tract?

3) can you identify some "natural experiments" that would allow you to infer some associations?

4) Are there other datasets available from Chicago that you could overlay?

5) Do you have other questions for me?
